# Calorie-Tracker
Fully responsive full-stack calorie tracking web app powered by PHP and MySQL. Created inside XAMPP and utilising its Apache and MySQL servers. Has a fully functioning login/signup system that makes use of password hashing and statement preparing to assist in the security of user data. Users are capable of inputting daily intake of energy and protein and have the app save and track progress for the day. Users also have the ability to export their data in the form as an excel spreadsheet that outlines all recorded data for the user. This is backed by a simple and sleek frontend that dynamically responds to the login status of the user and ensures responsive behaviour for all screen sizes.
